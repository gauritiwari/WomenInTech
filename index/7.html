    Radia was born in 1951 in New Jersey and attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and learned programming for a physics class. She received a B.S and M.S in mathematics and a PH. D in Computer science from MIT in 1988. In the 1970s Radia developed a child-friendly education language call TORTIS. The programming language was installed into a turtle and research was conducted on young children. In the 1980s Radia invented the spanning tree algorithm and the spinning tree protocol. The spinning tree algorithm transformed ethernet from a single wire CSMA into a protocol that could handle large clouds. Radia is known as the ‘mother of the internet’ and for creating STP which is fundamental for the operation of network bridges.

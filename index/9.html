    Karen Jones was born in 1935 and died in 2007, she studied history and philosophy at Grinton college in Cambridgeshire from 1953 to 1956. In the 1960s she started to work on information retrieval (IR) and introduced the IDF term weighting which has been adopted by modern systems such as web search engines. She was a major figure in setting standards for a large proportion of the work in natural language processing (NPL) in the US and other countries. She taught many PhD students in computer speech and language the diverse areas of NPL and IR. She is well known for working on the IR and introducing the IDF term to produce natural language for the search engines that we use daily.

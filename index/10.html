    Elizabeth was born in 1931 in West Virginia and was the first person in her family to attend University and receive an undergraduate degree from the West Liberty State College. Whilst working towards her PhD in biochemistry she discovered her love for data compilations when working at her part-time job. She decided not to carry on her PhD and from 1972-1989 she was a director of the network information systems centre at the Stanford research institute. The institute oversaw internet addresses and if you wanted a domain, you would have to go to Elizabeth. The network information centre was like the prehistoric google and by the late 1980s, the community had moved to the domain name system which helped lay the foundation for the modern internet. Elizabeth is well known for being one of the famous women in technology for helping the Stanford research institute transition to the domain name system and introducing the domain name protocol, sheâ€™s the one to thank for the dot coms, dot nets and dot govs used daily.

    Ada Lovelace was born in 1815 and died in 1852, she was born in London and was homeschooled by her mother and had several tutors. Her mother insisted that she was taught science and mathematics which went in her favour as she is now known as an English mathematician and writer. Ada is referred to as the first programmer because she had written notes that explained how the notion of a specific engine could transition calculation to computation. She is one of the famous women in technology and every second Tuesday in October is known as Ada Lovelace Day to celebrate the achievements of women in STEM careers.

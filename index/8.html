        Katherine Johnson was born in 1918 in West Virginia and was one of 3
        black students to attended West Virginias graduate college. In 1937 she
        received a B.S in Mathematics and French from the State School. After
        getting married and having a family, a relative told her about open
        positions at the all-black computing section at the National Advisory
        Committee of Aeronautics (NACA) laboratory. The launch of the Soviet
        satellite sputnik change history along with Kathrine Johnson’s life as
        she was the one who manually run the same equations through her desktop
        that the machine used to ensure that they were safe to go before
        take-off. This was a very big responsibility for Kathrine as the
        astronaut’s lives were in her hands and were not taking off until they
        received the signal from her. The flight was a success and marked a
        turning point in the competition between the US and the Soviet Union in
        space. Kathrine is well known for this event and is one of the famous
        women in technology for co-authoring 26 research reports that provide
        mathematic equations for machines.

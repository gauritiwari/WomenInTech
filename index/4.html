    Mary Wilkes was born in 1937 in Chicago and graduated from Wellesley College in 1959 with a degree in philosophy. She was told in the eighth grade by her geography teacher that she would be a computer programmer when she grew up. At the time Mary was unaware that this was going to become true. In her early years, she worked with computers such as the IBM 709 and IBM 704 for a year in 1959-1960. In 1961 she joined the digital computer group and contributed to the LNC development of TX-2, as she designed and wrote the operators manual for the final console design. She is known for helping develop the first personal computer and was also the first person to have a PC in her home.
